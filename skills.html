        <h3>TECHNICAL SKILLS</h3>
        <p>As a student, my technical skills are still developing, but I have a strong foundation in basic programming concepts. I have learned how to write simple programs using languages like Python, C#, and Java, which help me understand how coding works. I can create basic applications that take user input, process data, and display outputs. Additionally, I have experience with HTML and CSS, allowing me to design simple web pages with structured layouts. I understand the importance of logical thinking in programming and have practiced using loops, conditionals, and functions to solve problems. Debugging is another skill I am working on, as I try to identify and fix errors in my code efficiently. I am familiar with using development environments like Visual Studio Code, which makes coding easier. Although I am not yet an expert, I am eager to learn about databases and how they store and manage data. I have explored SQL and can write basic queries to retrieve information from a database. I also have a growing interest in JavaScript, which is essential for making websites interactive. I enjoy experimenting with small projects, such as building simple calculators and to-do list applications. I am also trying to understand the basics of cybersecurity to protect data from threats. My curiosity and passion for technology push me to keep learning and exploring new concepts.</p>

        <h3>LEADERSHIP SKILLS</h3>
        <p>Aside from technical skills, I also have leadership abilities that help me work well with others. I have experience leading small group projects in school, where I help my classmates organize tasks and meet deadlines. Communication is one of my strengths, as I always try to listen to different opinions and ensure everyone’s voice is heard. I believe that teamwork is essential in any project, so I encourage my classmates to collaborate and share ideas. Whenever challenges arise, I try to stay calm and find solutions instead of focusing on the problem. I also help motivate my group members when they feel discouraged or stuck on a difficult task. Time management is another skill I practice, ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and on schedule. My leadership skills have improved through class presentations, where I confidently explain topics and answer questions. I enjoy taking initiative, whether it’s organizing study sessions or guiding my peers during assignments.</p>

        <h3>PERSONAL SKILLS</h3>
        <p>In addition to my technical and leadership skills, I have various personal skills that help me in daily life. I am a creative thinker, always looking for new ways to solve problems and approach tasks. My adaptability allows me to adjust to different situations and challenges without feeling overwhelmed. My curiosity pushes me to explore new topics, whether they are related to technology or other fields of interest. I also have a good sense of organization, keeping my tasks and schedules well-structured to stay productive. I am an active listener, making sure I understand others before responding or making decisions. My determination helps me stay motivated even when I face setbacks or failures. I enjoy learning new skills, whether it’s a new programming language or a hobby like playing an instrument. These personal skills help me not only in academics but also in building meaningful relationships and preparing for my future.</p>
